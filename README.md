Authors: Antonia George, Nina McClure, Lenka Sefcakova

This was a final project completed for a Text Mining course taught by Hannes Mueller at Barcelona School of Economics for the Master of Data Science Methodology program (2022-2023).

Using NLP methods to analyze the language and rhetoric used by Australian politicians during federal election campaigns. We explore how politicians used language to appeal to different voter groups, what themes emerged in their speeches, and how their messages changed over time. We aim to shed light on the political landscape in Australia, the priorities of different political parties, and the factors that influence votersâ€™ decisions.
